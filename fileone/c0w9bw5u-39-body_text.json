Briefly, fertilized mouse eggs were flushed from the oviducts of superovulated C57BL/ 6NCrjBgi mice, and male pronuclei were injected with a 2.6 kb fragment (4 ng/ml) of 3D8 scFv that had been obtained by digesting the pcDNA3.1/V5-His B (3D8 scFv) vector with NruI/ StuI/PvuI restriction enzymes. The injected eggs were reimplanted in the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant C57BL/6NCrjBgi recipient females. At 3 weeks of age, the animals were tested for the presence of the transgene by PCR analysis of their genomic DNA using forward (59 CAGAGCTCTCTGGCTAACTAG 39) and reverse primers (59 CTGTTGAACAGACTCTGACTG 39). The 3D8scFv TG founders (F 0 lines) were mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi mice to establish the transgenic lines and produce siblings from the F 0 lines in a breeding program provided by Macrogen Co. The principles of laboratory animal care (NIH publication 85-23, revised 1986) were followed and all experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the NVRQS, Korea.", "denotations": []}
