However, the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines had 3,270 and 3,174 times more 3D8 scFv in the brain than that of the F 0 69 line, even 201.98 times more in F 0 110. Therefore, the F 0 69 line was used as a control and the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines were used for testing the antiviral preventive effects in TG mice lines after PRV infection ( Figure 7A) .", "denotations": []}
