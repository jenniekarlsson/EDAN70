This also indicates that PRV DNA was hydrolyzed immediately in virusinoculated STG90 muscle cells, and that the virus titer was not high enough to infect muscle cells. Therefore, PRV could not move systemically into the spinal cord or brain in STG90 mice. However, STG135 mice were not protected against PRV infection even though 3D8 scFv protein was expressed in the brain ( Figure 7A ) at similar levels to those observed in STG90 mice. We interpret these data to indicate that the expression and presence of antiviral proteins in inoculated cells and tissues is as important as high expression levels in target cells or tissues. Blood biochemistry ( Table 1 ) and body weight changes for 7 weeks after birth ( Figure S5A and S5B) were not significantly different between STG90 and WT mice. Also, we identified the expression patterns of endogenous genes including apoptosis (K-ras and BAX), growth factor (VEGF), and housekeeping (GAPDH) genes between STG90 and wild-type mice; however, there was no difference ( Figure S5C ).", "denotations": []}
