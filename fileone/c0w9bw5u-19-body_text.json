Figure 6 shows that 3D8 scFv did not hydrolyze methylated or histone-bound DNA when the activity of 3D8 scFv was ,1.4610 24 U/ml. This result indicates that chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was protected from 3D8 scFv because chromosomal DNA is mostly methylated and histone-bound., 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 cells are expressed at lower working concentrations than we tested in our in vitro analysis shown in Figure 6 .", "denotations": []}
