To test our hypothesis that 3D8 scFv acted as a DNase in the nucleus, we investigated whether 3D8 scFv could hydrolyze histone-bound DNA and methylated DNA. Both 3D8 scFv and DNase I at 10610 24 U/ml started to hydrolyze 0.2 mg DNA 1 hr after treatment. At a concentration of 8.3610 24 U/ml, 3D8 scFv digested more non-methylated DNA than methylated DNA after 1 hr of treatment ( Figure 6A ). In addition, quantitation of nonmethylated and methylated DNA showed a reduction rate of 62% and 21%, respectively ( Figure 6C) . However, no difference in hydrolysis of non-methylated and methylated DNA was observed when 8.3610 24 U/ml DNase I was tested ( Figure 6A ). Both 3D8 scFv and DNase I did not digest DNA at a concentration of 1.4610 24 U/ml, regardless of whether it was methylated or not ( Figure 6A ). We next tested whether the 3D8 scFv protein could digest histone-bound DNA in the nucleus. Histone-bound DNA fragments (150 bp) were not hydrolyzed by either 3D8 scFv or DNase I at concentrations of 10610 24 U/ml and 8.3610 24 U/ml, as shown in Figure 6B . But, at concentrations of 8.3610 24 U/ml 3D8 scFv, DNA without histones was reduced 34% and 90% after 1 hr and 3 hr, respectively ( Figure 6C) . Also, 3D8 scFv digested more DNA without histones than DNase I at concentrations of 8.3610 24 U/ml 1 hr after treatment ( Figure 6B ).", "denotations": []}
