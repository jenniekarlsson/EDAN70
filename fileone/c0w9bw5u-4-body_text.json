In addition, efficient degradation of RNAs by 3D8 scFv in the presence of EDTA demonstrates that 3D8 scFv does not need divalent metal ions for its RNase activity [23] . Additionally, 3D8 scFv has DNase and RNase activity but when the active sites of each VL and VH are changed from histidine (35 position in VH and 94 position in VL) to alanine, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant 3D8 scFv loses DNase activity but retains RNase activity [24] . We previously showed that 3D8 scFv can be applied to protect PK15 cells from virus infection. PK15 cells harboring 3D8 scFv show resistance to classical swine fever virus (CSFV) through RNase activity [25] . Also, we previously found that progenies of the transgenic tobacco plant acquired complete resistances against two single stranded (ss)-DNA geminiviruses, four ssRNA tobamoviruses, and one ssRNA cucumovirus [26, 27] . So far, chemicals or specific antibodies for viral proteins have been mostly used in antiviral agents. But, 3D8 scFv with a completely different mechanism than antiviral agents is expected to be effective against a broad spectrum of viral infections.", "denotations": []}
