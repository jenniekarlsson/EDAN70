Four F 1 lines (69 F 1 : 31, 33, 38, 208) were produced from the F 0 69 lines. Each of the four F 1 69 lines were mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi and then 20 F 2 69 lines were produced. They were used for virus challenge experiments and named STG69. In the case of the 90 and 135 F 1 lines, three F 1 90 lines (F 1 90: 45, 46, and 162) and five F 1 135 lines (F 1 135: 140, 142,   144 , 165, and 166) were produced and then 17 F 2 90 lines (STG90) and 24 F 2 135 lines (STG135) were prepared ( Figure S4A ). Genomic PCR was performed to confirm the transgenic lines at each generation from F 0 to F 2 (data not shown).", "denotations": []}
