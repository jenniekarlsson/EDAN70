SCH07072 cells produced up to 660 relative fluorescence units (RFU) 80 min after the 6carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNA substrate was introduced into the cells. However, the fluorescence output from HeLa cells, muSCH cells, and the negative control reactant was a maximum of 200 RFU or less ( Figure 4A ). When the FAM-labeled RNA substrate was introduced into cells, SCH07072 and muSCH cells had fluorescence levels of about 200 RFU, but HeLa cells and the negative control reactant showed fluorescence levels of only 80 RFU ( Figure 4B ). These FRET results confirmed that 3D8 scFv in SCH07072 had both DNase and RNase activity, but that only RNase activity was observed in muSCH cells ( Figure 4) . Therefore, the protection against the virus infection shown by SCH07072 cells was due to 3D8 scFv nuclease activity against the virus genome itself.", "denotations": []}
