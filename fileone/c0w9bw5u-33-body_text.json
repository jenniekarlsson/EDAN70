Cells on coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with Perm-buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin, 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr, 3D8 scFv-treated cells were incubated with rabbit anti-3D8 scFv Ab, followed by TRITC-anti-rabbit Ig. Nuclei were stained with DAPI during the last 10 min of incubation at RT. Cells on coverslips were mounted in Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA), and observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope and analyzed with Carl Zeiss LSM Image software (Jena, Germany). 3D8 scFv-transfected cell lines were assessed by flow cytometry. HeLa cells grown in sixwell plates (1610 5 cells/well) were pre-incubated in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37uC and were either untreated or treated with each inhibitor for 30 min at 37uC before 3D8 scFv (10 mM) treatment. Cells suspended with trypsin were treated once more with 0.1% trypsin for 3 min at 37uC to wash off surface-bound proteins. After washing with ice-cold PBS once, cells were fixed and permeabilized as per the procedures described above. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice, labeled with anti-rabbit 3D8 scFv Ab, followed by TRITC-antirabbit Ab, and then analyzed using a FACS Calibur TM (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 1610 4 cells were analyzed for each test.", "denotations": []}
