Northern blot analysis showed that the RNA stability and RNA expression patterns of three marker genes (GAPDH, actin, and VEGF) in the three cell lines were not affected by expression of the 3D8 scFv protein ( Figure S1B ). Taken together, expression of the 3D8 scFv protein in SCH07072 cells did not affect cell growth or viability.", "denotations": []}
