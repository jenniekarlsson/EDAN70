This innate immunosuppressive activity of the MERS-CoV M protein was due to its conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains. Our mechanistic study complemented the previous work that showed that MERS-CoV M protein had IFN-antagonizing activity. 22 Both studies demonstrated that MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IRF3 activity but not NF-\u03baB signaling. It is known that the activation of RIG-I and MAVS results in the activation of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. 28, [44] [45] [46] Our results indicated that the MERS-CoV M protein was capable of differentially suppressing the RIG-I-induced activation of IRF3 (Figure 2 ). This provides further support to the bifurcation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB signaling subsequent to RIG-I and MAVS activation. Further investigations should elucidate the mechanism by which the MERS-CoV M protein preferentially modulates IRF3 activators such as TBK1, while sparing NF-\u03baB activators such as CARD9. 47 We provided evidence that the TRAF3-TBK1 interaction as well as IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization were affected by the MERS-CoV M protein (Figure 4 ). Our findings fill the knowledge gap by providing novel mechanistic insight into the innate immunosuppressive activity of MERS-CoV M protein.", "denotations": []}
