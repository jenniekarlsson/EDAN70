Coronavirus M protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized predominantly to the Golgi complex and is required for virion assembly. [30] [31] [32] MERS-CoV M protein is of particular interest because SARS-CoV M protein also inhibits IFN production through a mechanism by which the formation of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK-\u03b5 complex is impeded to ablate the activation of IRF3 transcription factor. 30 In contrast, M protein encoded by human coronavirus HKU1 associated with common cold has no influence on IFN production. 32 Here we reported that the MERS-CoV M protein also specifically inhibited IRF3 activation but not NF-\u03baB signaling. MERS-CoV M protein was capable of interacting with TRAF3 adapter protein and hampered TRAF3-TBK1 interaction leading to diminished IRF3 activation. Using a chimeric protein containing the MERS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a dormant SARS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain, we confirmed that the N-terminal transmembrane domains of MERS-CoV M protein sufficiently account for its inhibitory effect. Although another chimera containing SARS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a MERS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain was fully competent in IFN antagonism, a truncation mutant lacking the functional first transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV M was not, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV M protein is largely dispensable for its immunosuppressive activity.", "denotations": []}
