The activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect. As described above, RIG-I N is a constitutively active mutant that resembles (1 \u03bcL/mL) in C for 16 h before harvest for dual-luciferase reporter assay. Bars represent the mean of three biological replicates (n = 3) and error bars indicate their s.d. The statistical significance between selected samples was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t-test for unpaired samples with equal variance and P-value (P) was indicated. Figure 3A ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). A similar result was also obtained using MAVS as an activator ( Figure 3B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which is a mitochondrial adapter that diverts the activation signal from RIG-I to the IRF3 and NF-\u03baB pathways. [44] [45] [46] [47] When activators committed to the IRF3 pathway were used, greater inhibitory effects were observed, as in the cases of TBK1 ( Figure 3C ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2) and IKK-\u03b5 ( Figure 3D ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which are kinases which recognize and phosphorylate IRF3 as direct substrate. [48] [49] [50] [51] Surprisingly, when a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 transcription factor (IRF3 5D), with five inducible phosphorylation sites at Ser/Thr residues mutated to Asp, 52 was employed, the expression of the M protein no longer quenched the IRF3-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter ( Figure 3E ), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation.", "denotations": []}
