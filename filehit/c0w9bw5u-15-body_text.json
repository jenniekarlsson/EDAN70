Particularly, the SN chimera contains the N-terminal transmembrane domains from SARS-CoV M protein and the C-terminal domain from MERS-CoV M protein, whereas the MN chimera contains the N-terminal transmembrane domains from the MERS-CoV M protein and the C-terminal domain from the SARS-CoV M protein ( Figure 5B ). The breakpoint was designed to occur immediately after the third predicted transmembrane domain at residue 106 and before the conserved Ser residue in both proteins at residue 107 ( Figure 5B ).", "denotations": []}
