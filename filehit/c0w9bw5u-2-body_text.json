[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] According to the World Health Organization, 1626 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported between September 2012 and 7 January 7 2016 with 586 related deaths in 26 countries. 10 In particular, 186 people were infected and 36 were killed in one recent outbreak in South Korea. 10 MERS-CoV is classified into lineage C of Betacoronavirus and is most phylogenetically related to two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5, providing insight on its evolutionary origin. 11, 12 MERS-CoV is a polycistronic positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of~30 Kb in size. The 5\u2032 most two-thirds of MERS-CoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are further cleaved to yield 16 non-structural proteins, whereas the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes several structural or lineage-specific proteins. 13 Upon infection, these proteins are expressed to facilitate viral replication and propagation in the host. 14 MERS-CoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, in patients as well as in animal and cellular infection models. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This has been attributed to the IFNantagonizing property of some MERS-CoV-encoded proteins, which directly perturb the host IFN production mechanisms, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] lending support to the notion that MERS-CoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 133}, "obj": "OBJ"}]}
