In a comparative analysis of MERS-CoV structural and accessory proteins, it has been shown that M, ORF4a, ORF4b and ORF5 possess IFN-antagonizing properties. 22 We, and others, have characterized the ORF4a protein as a dsRNA-binding protein that interferes with the activation of RLR by either a dsRNA ligand or the protein co-activator PACT. 24, 25 However, the molecular mechanisms through which other MERS-CoV proteins manipulate the RLR signaling pathway to disrupt IFN-\u03b2 expression have not been elucidated.", "denotations": []}
