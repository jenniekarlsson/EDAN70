To address this issue, two different luciferase reporter constructs, in which tandem copies of either IRF3-or NF-\u03baB-binding elements were inserted into their promoter region, were used. The truncation mutant of RIG-I known as RIG-I N that contains only the N-terminal CARD domain was chosen to be the inducer in these assays because it is constitutively active and highly competent to induce these two pathways. 28 The MERS-CoV M protein was able to suppress the promoter activity of the IRF3-driven luciferase construct in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), but no inhibitory effect was observed with the NF-\u03baB-driven construct ( Figure 2B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2) although the canonical inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 could efficiently blunt its activation as a positive control ( Figure 2B ; bar 6 compared with bar 2). Hence, the suppressive effect of the MERS-CoV M protein is specific for IRF3 signaling but not NF-\u03baB activation.", "denotations": []}
