Non-denaturing native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as previously described. 36, 39, 40 Bioinformatic analysis Sequence alignment was performed using Cluster Omega, an online tool based on the hidden Markov model, 41 and hosted by the EMBL-EBI server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Transmembrane domain prediction was performed using TMFinder, which considers hydrophobicity and helicity of the amino-acid sequence (http://tmfinder.research.sickkids.ca/). 42 ", "denotations": []}
